Learning Git 
What is Git?
Git is a tool that helps developers work together on software projects. It keeps tracks of changes in the code, making it easy for multiple people to collaborate without messing things up. 

Git command-
git clone - clonning a repositoy on the local machine
git inti - initialize a new Git repository
git version- displays the installed git version
git status - displays the state of the code.
git add <-file name-> adds new or changed files tin your working directory to the git staging area
git add. adds all
git commit - it is the recod of change.
git commit -m "some message"
git commit --amend: changes to the most recent commit

remote-
git remote add origin <respository_url>
git remote -v to verify remote

branch
git branch- check branch
git branch -M <name> to rename
git checkout <b-name> to navigate
git checkout -b <new-b> create new
git checkout -d <b-name> delete b

push-
git push origin <branch> or main upload local repo to remote repo

pull-
git pull origin <branch> or main - fetch and merge changes from a remote repository

diff-
git diff<branch_name> - to compare commits, branches, files and more

log
git log - display commit history

undoing changes-
Case 1 - staged changes
git reset <file_name> 
git reset  // reset all

Case 2 - commit changes (for one)
git reset HEAD~1

Case 3. commit changes (for many)
git reset <commit-hash>
git reset --hard <commit-hash>


merge- merges one branch into another with 2 ways
1. Using git merge command
git merge <branch_name>

2. Using pull request (Github)


Blobs- Binary Large Object
Each version of a file is represented by blob. A blobb holds the file data but doesnot contain any metadata about the file.

Trees-
 Tree is an object which represents a directory. It holds blobs as well as other sub-directories.

Commits - 
Commit holds the current state of the repository. A commit is also named by SHA1 hash.

Branches -
Branches are used to create another line of development. By default git has a master branches. Usually, a branch is created to work on a new features.Once the feature is completed, it is merged back with the master branch and delete the branch. 

Tags - 
Tag assigns a meaningful name with a specific version in the repository.

Clone-
Creates a instance of repositories.  Clone operation not only checks out the working copy, but it also mirrors the complete repository. 

Pull - 
Pull operation copies the changes from a remote repository instance to a local one. 

Push-
Push operation copies changes from a local repository instance to a remote one. 

Head-
head is a pointer, which points to the latest commit in the branch.
