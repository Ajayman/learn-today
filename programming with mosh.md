### Different between ECMAScript and Javascript
  ECMAScript is just specification and its just a standard. ECMAScript released in 2015 is ES6
  Javascript is programming language using that ECMAScript standard
  
### Variables  
variables are like boxes where we can put anything.Box got name which is called as identifier in programming term. 
  in Es6 standard we use let as variable. 
  Variable must have certain features like
    1. Cannot be a reserved keyword
    2. Should be meaningful word
    
### Constants 
  The fixed value in variable should be declared constant keyword
  ```
    For Example : 
    const interestRate = 10;
    here interestRate value wont change if assigned another value;
  ```
