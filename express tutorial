## What is Express.js
  ` Express.js is a Node.js Framework. It's the most popular framework as of now (the most starred on NPM).
  ExpressJS is a web application framework that provides you with a simple API to build websites, web apps and back ends.
  `
  
  ## why do we actually need Express.js? How it is useful for us to use with Node.js?
    try to write a small Rest API server in plain Node.js (that is , using only core modules) and then in Express.js. The latter will take you 5-10x less time and lines of code.

## Features
  1. Robust routing
  2. Focus on high performance
  3. Super-high test coverage
  4. HTTP helpers (redirection, caching, etc)
  5. View system supporting 14+ template engines
  6. Content negotiation
  7. Executable for generating applications quickly



## Express code
`const express = require("express");
 const app = express();

 app.get(route, callback)
 app.get("/", (req,res))
 `
 
 ### THe callback function has 2 paramters, request(req) and response(res). THe request object(req) represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query
 string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, etc.
 ### Similarly, the response object represents the HTTP response that the Express app sends when it receive an HTTP request.
 
 
# Express JS is mostly useful for API and routing

# Express JS routing
# send html & json data as a response using Express js
