Session based:
    session based authentication means when loged in the server creates and stores session then server response data with the 
    cookie session id. Every time the server checks the session id when clients request to the server.
    
Token based:
    it is similar to session based only the server stores session id but token is secretly stored and every time the client request 
   with the token.

    JSON Web Token is a standard used to create access tokens for an application. It works this way the server generates a token that certifies the user identity, and send
    it to the client. THe client will send the toke back to the server for every subsequent request , so the server knows the request comes form a particular identity. 
    THis architecture proces to be very effective in modern Web Apps, where after the user is authenticated we perform API requests either to a REST or a GraphQL API.
   
   The token is created and is attached to the cookies and verifies on every request whether the client is authenticated or not.
   
   # JSON web token structure
    1. header
    2. Payload
    3. Signature
    typically looks like
